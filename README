Impressions Readme
---------------

To install:
run make in the impressions directory

To run:
./impress <inputfile>

Default input file is ./inputfile

Additional software required in extension_helpers:
id3v2 for mp3
gif for gif/jpeg files

Input file format:

Parent_Path: /nitin/beagle/impress_home/ 1

Specify where to create the test file system
1/0 toggles whether this will be used or not

Actuallogfile: /root/impress/Desksearch/Results/Logs 0

Specify where log files will be maintained
1/0 toggles whether this will be used or not

Randseeds: Direct 10 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100

Specify seeds for random number generators to ensure reproducibility
If more randseeds are needed, change the number right after "Direct"
which specifies the number of random seeds

FScapacity: 100 GB

Total capacity of the disk, does not affect anything.

FSused: 45 GB

Size of the desired file system. The actual created file system
can be a  little off from the desired value.

Numfiles: NO K

Number of files desired. First arg is number, second arg is unit
N for 10^0, K for 10^3, M for 10^6, B for 10^9
if first arg is NO implies Impressions will calculate based on FSused.

Numdirs: NO K

Number of directories desired. First arg is number, second arg is unit
N for 10^0, K for 10^3, M for 10^6, B for 10^9
if first arg is NO implies Impressions will calculate based on FSused.

Filesperdir: 10.2 N

Mean number of files in a directory

FilesizeDistr: Direct 3 99994 29 0.91 

File size distribution. 3 is number of params.
First arg is bias for lognormal out of 100000
Second arg is exponent for pareto base (Xm)
Third arg is pareto shape (alpha)

FilecountDistr: Direct 2 9.48 2.45663283
File count/size distribution lognormal
First arg is mu
Second arg is sigma

Dircountfiles: Direct 2 2 2.36
Directory sizes inverse polynomial distribution

DirsizesubdirDistr: Indir DirsizesubdirDistr.txt

Fileswithdepth: Direct 10

Layoutscore: 1.0 

Desired layout score, 1.0 is perfectly laid out

Actualfilecreation: 1

If this is 0 then no files and dirs will be created
if this is 2 then only dirs will be created
